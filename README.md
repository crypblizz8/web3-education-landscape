Web3 is here to stay and education will a larger driver to bring new people into the space. Particularly with regards to development and user onboarding, more people are dipping their toes with DAO contributions and learning.

Web3 Education represents a paradigm shift between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0

These categories and projects are spearheading the education space. By thinking of new coordination, mechanism designs, and incentives to learn, this will continue to grow.

*The following projects focus primarily on Web3 Development + general user onboarding. Feel free to submit a PR with a Category Name / URL + Description.*
